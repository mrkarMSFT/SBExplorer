# SBExplorer

The Service Bus Explorer allows users to connect to a Service Bus namespace and efficiently administer messaging entities. The tool provides advanced features like import/export functionality or the ability to test topic, queues, subscriptions, relay services, notification hubs and events hubs.

You can download the tool from here and run the "ServiceBusExplorer.exe" to start using the tool if you don't have visual studio installed in your machine.
